            Hayao Miyazaki is a world-renowned Japanese animator, director, and
            co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He was born on January 5, 1941, in
            Tokyo, Japan. Miyazaki began his career as an animator in the 1960s,
            working at various studios before co-founding Studio Ghibli in 1985
            with fellow director Isao Takahata.

            Miyazaki is best known for his imaginative storytelling, deep
            environmental themes, and strong female characters. His films, such
            as <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>, <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, and
            <em>Spirited Away</em>, have received international acclaim and have
            become beloved by audiences around the world.
          </p>

            In 2003, <em>Spirited Away</em> won the Academy Award for Best
            Animated Feature, making Miyazaki the first Japanese director to
            receive this honor. Even after announcing retirement several times,
            he continues to return to filmmaking, driven by his passion and
            creativity. His latest film, <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> (2023),
            marks another milestone in his legendary career.
